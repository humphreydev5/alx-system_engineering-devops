0x09. Web infrastructure design


0. Simple web stack

A lot of websites are powered by simple web infrastructure, a lot of time it is composed of a single server with a LAMP stack.

On a whiteboard, design a one server web infrastructure that hosts the website that is reachable via www.foobar.com. Start your explanation by having a user wanting to access your website.

Requirements:

You must use:
1 server
1 web server (Nginx)
1 application server
1 application files (your code base)
1 database (MySQL)
1 domain name foobar.com configured with a www record that points to your server IP 8.8.8.8
You must be able to explain some specifics about this infrastructure:
What is a server
What is the role of the domain name
What type of DNS record www is in www.foobar.com
What is the role of the web server
What is the role of the application server
What is the role of the database
What is the server using to communicate with the computer of the user requesting the website
You must be able to explain what the issues are with this infrastructure:
SPOF
Downtime when maintenance needed (like deploying new code web server needs to be restarted)
Cannot scale if too much incoming traffic
Please, remember that everything must be written in English to further your technical ability in a variety of settings.


1. Distributed web infrastructure

On a whiteboard, design a three server web infrastructure that hosts the website www.foobar.com.

Requirements:

You must add:
2 servers
1 web server (Nginx)
1 application server
1 load-balancer (HAproxy)
1 set of application files (your code base)
1 database (MySQL)
You must be able to explain some specifics about this infrastructure:
For every additional element, why you are adding.
